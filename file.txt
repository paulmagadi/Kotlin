Creating a triangle using a nested for-loop

fun main() {
    for (i in 1..5) {
        for (j in 1..i) {
            print("*")
        }
        println()
    }
}


Parametrizing a triangle

fun main() {
    val height = 10
    for (i in 1..height) {
        for (j in 1..i) {
            print("*")
        }
        println()
    }
}


downTo function
You've also learned how to make a triangle that starts with five stars and ends with one.

fun main() {
    for (i in 1..5) {
        val numberOfStars = 6 - i
        for (j in 1..numberOfStars) {
            print("*")
        }
        println()
    }
}

There is also an alternative way to implement that. You can use the downTo function, and in such a case, the for-loop variable does not indicate what the row number is. Instead, it indicates how many stars you should have in the following row. 

fun main() {
    for (numberOfStars in 5 downTo 1) {
        for (i in 1..numberOfStars) {
            print("*")
        }
        println()
    }
}
